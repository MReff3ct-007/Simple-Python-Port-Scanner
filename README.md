# Simple Python Port Scanner

This project is a basic port scanner written in Python 3. It scans a target IP
address or website for open TCP ports and displays any that are found.

## Modules Used

This script only uses built-in Python modules:

- `socket` – used to create network connections and scan ports
- `sys` – used for exiting the program safely
- `re` – used to check if the input is a valid IP address or hostname
- `datetime` – used to show when the scan starts and ends

## Notes

- No external libraries are required
- Works with Python 3
- Made for learning and basic security testing

## Run

```bash
python3 run.py
